Introduction

I chose the topic of Airlines Safety because ensuring the safety of human lives is of critical importance in the aviation industry. Air travel is an integral part of daily life for millions of people, and the safety of these journeys is the cornerstone of the industry. The purpose of Airlines Safety projects is to enhance the safety of air travel and minimize potential risks. These projects involve measures such as updating safety equipment, renewing staff training, and reviewing safety protocols. In summary, airline safety is a fundamental issue for maintaining industry reputation and ensuring passenger safety.
